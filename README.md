A Discord Bot & REST Library for Nim. [Discord API Channel](https://discord.gg/7jgdC9E)

Why Dimscord?
 * It is minimalistic and efficient. 
 * Nim is a good programming language and I believe that Nim should stand a chance on having an up-to-date good enough discord library.
 * It has REST mode only feature, which isn't cache reliant.
 * The other nim discord library has bunch of issues and it's unmaintained.
 
 ## FAQ:
 * What is Nim?
   * Nim is a statically-typed programming language (older than go and rust) that compiles to C/C++/JavaScript.
   It is similar to Python, easier to learn and it's flexible. [You can read it more in the official website for Nim.](https://nim-lang.org)
 * Why even use Nim for discord bots?
   * Since it's easier to learn, it's more faster than any other interpreted languages,
    which is beneficial, for larger discord bots, so they could run faster.
    [You can read the Nim FAQ here](https://nim-lang.org/faq.html)

## Notes:
 * For compressing data and stuff you would need a zlib1 file to be installed, you can put it at your `.nimble/bin` directory or just simply put it at your folder. They have to be either a dylib, dll or so.1 file.
 * Voice support will be added.
 * If your bot is in a large guild (>50-250 large_threshold), I'd recommend turning off guild_subscriptions or use intents, if you want to get a guild member use the requestGuildMembers proc, that way you can get a specific guild member from a large guild; if you have presence intent enabled and you are debugging with a large guild,
 dont debug because it will slow down your bot.

## Getting Started:
1. Install Nim using [choosenim](https://github.com/dom96/choosenim) or [Nim's website](https://nim-lang.org/install.html)

2. Install Dimscord via Nimble using `nimble install dimscord` or Github `git clone https://github.com/krisppurg/dimscord`
   * You will need at least Nim 1.2.0 to install dimscord
 
3. Read the Wiki or Examples for referencing. Maybe even rewrite your bot if you want to switch.
 
4. Start coding! Stay up-to-date with the latest Dimscord release and stuff.

## Quick Example:
```nim
import dimscord, asyncdispatch, times, options

let discord = newDiscordClient("<your bot token goes here>")

# Handle event for on_ready.
discord.events.on_ready = proc (s: Shard, r: Ready) {.async.} =
    echo "Ready as " & $r.user

# Handle event for message_create.
discord.events.message_create = proc (s: Shard, m: Message) {.async.} =
    if m.author.bot: return
    if m.content == "!ping": # If message content is "!ping".
        let
            before = epochTime() * 1000
            msg = await discord.api.sendMessage(m.channel_id, "ping?")
            after = epochTime() * 1000
        # Edit the message!
        # Use 'discard' because editMessage returns a new message.
        discard await discord.api.editMessage(
            m.channel_id,
            msg.id, 
            "Pong! took " & $int(after - before) & "ms | " & $s.latency() & "ms."
        )
    elif m.content == "!embed": # Otherwise if message content is "!embed".
        # Sends a messge with embed.
        discard await discord.api.sendMessage(
            m.channel_id,
            embed = some Embed(
                title: some "Hello there!", 
                description: some "This is description",
                color: some 0x7789ec
            )
        )

# Connect to Discord and run the bot.
waitFor discord.startSession()
```
Please make sure that when you are running your discord bot you would need to define `-d:ssl` example: `nim c -r -d:ssl main.nim`, you can use `-d:dimscordDebug`, if you want to debug.
