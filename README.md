A Discord Bot & REST Library for Nim.

Why Dimscord?
 * It is a bit more straightforward.
 * Nim is a good programming language and I believe that Nim should stand a chance on having a good enough discord library.
 * It has REST mode feature.
 * The other nim discord library has bunch of issues and also the way of handling.
 
 ## FAQ:
 What is Nim?
   * Nim is a young statically-typed programming language that compiles to C/C++/JavaScript. It's similar to python and it's syntax is more clear. [You can read it more in the official website for Nim](https://nim-lang.org)

## Notes:
 * This library is 90% finished (estimate).
 * When running your discord bot you would need to define `-d:ssl` e.g. `nim c -r -d:ssl yourfilename.nim`

 * For compressing data and stuff you would need zlib1.dll to be installed, you can put it at your `.nimble/bin` directory or just simply put it at your folder.

 * For contributing you should use the devel branch.
 
 * You should either use the devel branch, if there's issues with this branch.

 * The documentation for the library is https://krisppurg.github.io/dimscord/0.0.9/dimscord.html
 
 * There is an issue with the websocket.nim library (0.5.0), where if you connect your discord bot the socket will close, try using either 0.4.0 or 0.4.1. 

 * Voice support will be added on later.

## Quick Example:
```nim
import dimscord, asyncdispatch, times

let cl = newDiscordClient("<token>")

cl.events.on_ready = proc (s: Shard, r: Ready) = # Add Event Handler for on_ready.
    echo "Connected to Discord as " & $r.user

cl.events.message_create = proc (s: Shard, m: Message) = #  Add Event Handler for message_create.
    if m.author.bot: return
    if m.content == "!ping": # if message content is "!ping"
        let before = getTime().utc.toTime.toUnix
        let msg = waitFor cl.api.sendMessage(m.channel_id, "ping?")
        let after = getTime().utc.toTime.toUnix 
        asyncCheck cl.api.editMessage(m.channel_id, msg.id, "Pong! took " & $int(after - before) & "ms | " & $s.getPing() & "ms.") # Edit the message as pong! asyncCheck means that it  will only raise an exception if it fails.
    elif m.content == "!embed": # otherwise if content is embed
        asyncCheck cl.api.sendMessage(m.channel_id, embed = ?Embed( # Sends a messge with embed. The '?' symbol is a shorthand for 'some' in options.
            title: ?"Hello there!", 
            description: ?"This is a cool embed",
            color: ?5))

waitFor cl.startSession(compress=true)
```
